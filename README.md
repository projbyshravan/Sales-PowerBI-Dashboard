# Sales-PowerBI-Dashboard
## Project Objective

The objective of this Power BI dashboard is to provide a comprehensive sales analysis for mobile sales from 2021 to 2024. By visualizing key metrics such as sales performance, customer demographics, and regional trends, the dashboard helps the store owner gain actionable insights into customer behavior, popular products, and sales patterns. This enables informed decisions to enhance sales strategies, improve customer engagement, and optimize inventory management.
